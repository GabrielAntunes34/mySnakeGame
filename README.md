# Snake Game in C

## Description (still in the making)

This project idea is to make an small but yet extendable snake game in C language, using some basic concepts of TAD programming and data structures besides being a way to learn the Ncurses library, which is being used to make the simple graphical representations of the game inside the Terminal.
